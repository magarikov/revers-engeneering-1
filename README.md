# revers-engeneering-1
In this project you can find:  
- 4 functions to detect debugging  
- 3 different exmples of anti-disassembly methods  
- 2 fuctions of detecting virtual machines  
- not-linery obfuscation  
- countiong CRC dynamically (have some mistake)  
- self-modyfaing  
- simple encryption  

All of mentioned methods are in Source.c. Program is designed for x86 (because of using asm insertions).  
As a source file for this project I took my oooold program for making notes. It uses trees to operate information.  
  
File "revers1.exe" is a hacked version of file (using binary patching)
